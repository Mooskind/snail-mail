        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            It is a big snail, whose shell is about 1.1-1.7 inches high, and about 1.1 to 1.9 inches wide. It constitutes about one-third of the total weight of the snail and protects its internal organs. It has a brown color, 3 to 5 bands or darker stripes and 4 to 5 spirals. The opening of the shell is large, with white edges.
            <br><br>
            The Helix pomatia is an air-breathing land snail that has a creamy to light brown shell with darker brown bands.
            <br><br>
            Roman snails have a single lung and a muscular foot that helps with locomotion. The foot contracts to produce movement and glands within it release a mucus that reduces friction with the underneath surface, reducing risks of damaging their skin.
            <br><br>
            Another important anatomical feature is the two pairs of tentacles in the head. The uppermost pair has the eyes, while the lower contains smell sensors.

        <h2>Behavior</h2>
        <p>
            The trails left on the ground when the snail moves are mucus produced by the foot and have an important function: facilitate movement on rough or very slippery surfaces. Also, it helps snails to follow their way back to the place where they were and return hours later, as a kind of reminder.
            <br><br>
            During the winter, Roman snails enter a state of inactivity that allows them to survive the low temperatures, like bears and other animals that usually hibernate. To do this, they first dig a hole in the ground and retract into their shell. Finally, they block the entrance with a layer of mucus called epiphragm, which helps to maintain its body temperature and protects the entry from organisms that could attack them.
