        <p>
            The Giant African Land Snail is one of the largest terrestrial gastropods. 
            They have a light to dark brown shells with vertical stripes of a darker shade of brown on them.
            <br><br>
            They have an average lifespan of about 5-7 years. When they have enough food, and the weather is satisfactory, they tend to live much longer. Some of them have been known to live up to 10 years.
            <br><br>
            The “Achatina fulica” is one of the most invasive species in the world and the United States Department of Agriculture consider it as one of the most damaging species for the agriculture and crops in the country. It is known to eat at least 500 different species of plants.
            <br><br>
            This species is on the list of the 100 most harmful invasive alien species in the world, but Achatina fulica does not seem to surrender. This snail that stands out for its large size has easily adapted to life in regions outside its natural habitat and is considered one of the biggest land snails.

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            The shell of the giant African snail reaches up to 7.8 inches in length and 2.7-3.9 inches in height. An adult weighs about 32 grams. The body has two short tentacles and two long ones that have the eyes.
            <br><br>
            The shell has an appearance conical and narrow, with 7 to 9 spirals visible on its surface. The color is not always the same; it depends on the environmental conditions of the site where the snail dwells. It is usually slightly dark brown or reddish with yellowish vertical stripes. The opening is relatively small.
            <br><br>
            An important part of the anatomy of this snail is a structure in the mouth similar to a tongue, which is called the radula. It has small teeth that allow snails to scrap the food before eating it.
            <br><br>
            They have a “muscular foot” that helps them move releasing a mucus while they move to reduce friction and avoid damage to their tissues.
            <br><br>
            The shell is the location where the Giant African Land Snail takes refuge from predators. They will also spend time inside of their shells when the temperatures begin to dip too low at night for their comfort.

        <h2>Behavior</h2>
        <p>
            Achatina fulica is mostly active during the night, and during the day it remains dormant, often buried beneath the ground to stay safe from predators. It is not a social species. On the contrary, it lives all its life alone; Not even after laying eggs, it establishes any bond with its offspring.
            <br><br>
            Besides the USDA, several state governments like Idaho, Georgia, and Florida among others have listed this species as highly invasive and set controls to avoid their proliferation. The global invasive species database, have listed the Achatina fulica in the top 100 of their rank and associations like invasive.org have made similar warnings.
            <br><br>
            The Giant African Land Snails don’t seem to interact with each other except for when they are going to mate. They don’t produce any sounds, and they spend their time moving, eating, and resting.
            <br><br>
            They are considered to be active between 9 C and 29 C degrees, but they can survive above 2 C degrees by hibernating inside of their shell during the colder months. During this time, they can slow down their metabolism, so they don’t need to eat or move during that period. They can remain inside of the shell for several months before they emerge again.

        <h2>Predators</h2>
        <p>
            The natural predators of this species are caterpillars, ground beetles, other species of snails, and many types of vertebrates. This said, nature doesn’t limit predators and mammals such as the gray fox from praying on this snail as well.
