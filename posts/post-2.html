            The garden snail (Helix aspersa) is a terrestrial gastropod mollusk and one of the best-known species in the world. It is so common that it is one of the most proliferated terrestrial mollusks.
            <br><br>
            The helix aspersa is also known as “European Brown Garden Snail,” but its scientific is under discussion. Some scientists think this snail is “Cornu aspersum,” “Cantareus aspersus” or “Cryptomphalus aspersus.”
            <br><br>
            This species is native to Europe but now lives in several parts of the world where it has become a pest of crops and gardens.

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            The Helix aspersa is an air-breathing snail, which has a single lung. They have a brownish soft body, covered with slimy mucus and yellow or cream-colored shells with brown spiral stripes. The shell of this species has a height of about 0-9-1.3 Inches, and a width of 0.9-1.5 inches and a lip appears at its edge when an individual is old.
            <br><br>
            It is a small mollusk, with a shell that has a sphere shape and a slightly rough surface, with about 4 or 5 spirals. Not all individuals have the shell of the same color; some have it dark brown, but the majority has it light brown or with a golden hue; also, it shows several brown or yellow stripes. This shell has a large opening whose edges are white.
            <br><br>
            This mollusk has a soft body protected by the shell, but when it is not feeding or when it feels danger, it retracts to its shell.
            <br><br>
            The garden snail has a flat “muscular foot” that helps it move with a gliding motion aided by the release of mucus to reduce the friction with the surface. This mucus is the reason of the trace that snails leave when they move around.

        <h2>Behavior</h2>
        <p>
            The garden snail is a terrestrial species with nocturnal habits; it does most of its day-to-day activities at night or very early in the morning, but if it rains during the day, it usually goes out.
            <br><br>
            In hot or drought periods, Helix aspersa retracts in its shell and covers the opening with a layer of mucus called epiphragm, which helps to keep the moisture inside and avoid the attack of animals that can kill it, like some ants. After doing this, it enters a state of inactivity that compares to hibernation. But not all snails hibernate. For example, in Southern California, young individuals are often active throughout the year.
            <br><br>
            Some of these snails hibernate during winter months, especially when they are mature, but they return to activity with the spring.

        <h2>Predators</h2>
        <p>
            Garden snails are a food source for some animals like lizards, frogs, and worms. Predatory insects and other species of snails will also eat garden snails.
            <br><br>
            Some birds, especially ducks will feed on these snails.
